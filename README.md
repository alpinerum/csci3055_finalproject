#Swift

##Introduction

  Swift is a programming language developed by Apple Inc for iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, Linux and z/OS. Swift is also open-source with its source code divided into multiple open source repositories hosted on Github.

##Syntax

  Let's start with a simple print statement, in Swift to print is pretty simple 
  `print("hello world")`
  Like Python3 and Java, functions require braces `()` to accept parameters, in this case the string "hello world" was passed as a parameter into the print function.
